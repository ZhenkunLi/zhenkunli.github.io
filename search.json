    "text": "News and updates\n July 21, 2023. Together with Dr. Mario Puppio, Dr. Marco Tanganelli, and Dr. Filippo Landi, we are managing a special issue entitled “Evaluation of Buildings’ and Infrastructures’ Performance and Analysis of Seismic and Naturally Induced Disasters” in the journal of Applied Sciences (IF=2.7). Research on new design strategies, modern architectural and structural concepts for the new structures, machine learning, innovation in material technology or construction chain, or the retrofit of the ancient and traditional structures will be considered for publication.\n July 20, 2023. The paper “High-Fidelity Time-Series Data Synthesis based on Finite Element Simulation and Data Space Mapping”(link will be soon available) authored by Youqi Zhang, myself, Rui Hao, Weiwei Lin, Lingfang Li and Di Su is accepted by Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing. In this paper, I was responsible for Finite Element Modeling using Abaqus driven by Python. One interested in this paper can find its preprint version in Publications.\n July 2-6, 2023. I am attending IALCCE 2023 in Milano, Italy. More pictures can be found HERE. Thanks, all friends, for the interesting topics and nice dinner.\n June 15, 2023. My paper “Bridge Frequency Scanning Using the Contact-Point Response of an Instrumented 3D Vehicle: Theory and Numerical Simulation” co-authored with Weiwei Lin and Youqi Zhang is accepted by Structural Control and Health Monitoring.\n June 8, 2023. My paper “Indirect damage identification for bridges using passing and temporarily parked vehicles” co-authored with Yifu Lan and Weiwei Lin is accepted by Engineering Structures.\n April 6, 2023. Zhenkun Li was awarded an incentive grant in Fabian and Jaakko Ahvenainen Foundation grants awarded for the year 2022."
