    "text": "Description\nIt is common for organizations to collect huge amounts of data over time, and existing time series analysis tools are not always suitable to handle the scale, frequency and structure of the data collected. In this workshop, we will look at some packages and methods that have been developed to handle the analysis of large collections of time series.\nDay 1: We look at the tsibble data structure for flexibly managing collections of related time series. We look at how to do data wrangling, data visualizations and exploratory data analysis. We explore feature-based methods to explore time series data in high dimensions. A similar feature-based approach can be used to identify anomalous time series within a collection of time series, or to cluster or classify time series. Primary packages for day 1 are tsibble, lubridate and feasts (along with the tidyverse of course).\nDay 2 is about forecasting. We look at some classical time series models and how they are automated in the fable package, and we will explore the creation of ensemble forecasts and hybrid forecasts. Best practices for evaluating forecast accuracy will also be covered. Finally, we will look at forecast reconciliation, allowing millions of time series to be forecast in a relatively short time while accounting for constraints on how the series are related."
