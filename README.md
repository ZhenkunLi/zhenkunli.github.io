# Zhenkun's Website

Hello, welcome to visit my website! In my web, I will share some basic infomation about me. You can visit it directly by [zhenkunli.com](https://zhenkunli.com). In future 10 years, I will update it as soon as possible if there are any updates about me. I will be dedicating to Structural Health Monitoring of infrastructures using Artificial Intelligence(AI) techniques such as Machine Learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I believe these will change the world in the nearly 8-15 years. 

Besides, I would like to share some stories in my past time. I hope these stories can be remembered by me and can inspire somebody other than me. 

## Currently

- Now, I am a beginner of HTML and CSS, and try to learn Javascript in the near future. But it is just a hobby, and I am pretty interested in these skills. 

## Future

- Hopefully, I will pursue a M. Sc. in computer science in the future(maybe in 4-5 years if everything goes well in my PhD period). 

## Motto

Life is long, never stop pursuing my dreams!
